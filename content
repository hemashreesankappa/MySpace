Testimonial:

1. We had a great experience with MySpace for an estimate for a bathroom. They gave some good ideas on how we can organize our space which was very helpful, thank you!

2.As first home homeowners, my husband and I needed some guidance. MySpace was great at helping us with all different details - from finding tiles for bathroom walls to little things like picking the right area rugs. It was a pleasure working with them and would highly recommend her to anyone!

MySpace is one of the best designers in the town. They are Reliable, great ideas, fresh and very positive. They listen to their client's needs and try work within their budget. I work with a lot of designers and have to say they are one of the best.
